# Confusion

In this experimental game that simulates a college student's day, the user's input does not work in a 1:1 ratio as in most games. The computer decides randomly what direction your character goes. This is an artistic choice, and the game is meant to frustrate the user with this context in mind to spur critical thought about the world around them.

Future possibilities for this project would involve giving it a JAVA Swing GUI or an HTML site representation.
